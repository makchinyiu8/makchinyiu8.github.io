<h1>Our Teachers</h1>

<h2>Mr. Chiu</h2>
<p class="teacherSummary">Joyful House was founded in 2003 by Mr. Caesar Chiu, who realized that learning instruments can be quite stressful due to a multitude of reasons, and wanted to foster a safe, comfortable learning environment for students.</p>
<p class="teacherSummary">Mr. Chiu realized his passion for the arts at a very young age, but was forced to study under quite a challenging environment.</p>
<p class="teacherSummary">Thankfully, he never lost his flame and wants to pass on the torch to others who wish to play modern instruments.</p>
<p class="teacherSummary">He has graduated from the Berklee College of Music located in the United States and has received multiple awards for his performances.</p> 
<p class="teacherSummary">Under his tutelage, his students will certainly be able to perform at top levels.</p>

<h2>Mr. Lok</h2>
<p class="teacherSummary">A close and dear friend of Mr. Chiu, Mr. Lok teaches both guitars and bass, and his skill will certainly show itself.</p>
<p class="teacherSummary">Surpassing Grade 8 and above in all 3 instruments, he is more than capable of teaching any student and overcoming any challenge.</p>
<p class="teacherSummary">His stage presence and charisma have allowed him to perform in many concerts across Hong Kong, and is the guitarist of a band called "The Croks".</p>
<p class="teacherSummary">If you aspire to be in a band, there is no one better to teach you than Mr. Lok.</p>

<h2>Ms. Lok</h2>
<p class="teacherSummary">Proficient both in the drums and in teaching, Ms. Lok is one of the best teachers you will ever meet.</p>
<p class="teacherSummary">Working in the Joyful House Playgroup before transferring here, she is the most experienced with kids and her teaching methods.</p>
<p class="teacherSummary">Studying overseas at the Berklee College of Music alongside Mr. Chiu, she has received her diploma in drumming and is working to pass her talents on to others.</p>
